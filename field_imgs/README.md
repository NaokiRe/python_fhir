# Field Images

This folder contains images for each extracted field from the PDF. Each image is a PNG file.

## Naming Convention

The images are named according to the following pattern:

```
<field_name>_<page_number>.png
```

Where:
- `<field_name>` is the name of the field extracted from the PDF.
- `<page_number>` is the page number of the PDF where the field was extracted.

For example, the image `name_1.png` contains the extracted field `name` from the first page of the PDF.

Please note that the actual names of the images will depend on the names of the fields extracted from the PDF.
